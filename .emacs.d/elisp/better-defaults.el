;;; Commentary:

;; There are a number of unfortunate facts about the way Emacs works
;; out of the box. While all users will eventually need to learn their
;; way around in order to customize it to their particular tastes,
;; this package attempts to address the most obvious of deficiencies
;; in uncontroversial ways that nearly everyone can agree upon.

;; Obviously there are many further tweaks you could do to improve
;; Emacs, (like those the Starter Kit and similar packages) but this
;; package focuses only on those that have near-universal appeal.
